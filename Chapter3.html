        <h3>History in spring</h3>
        <p>
          There are a lot of historic events that happened in spring time that shaped the world. On the 16th of
          April 1945, the battle of Berlin took place. This was when the allies made their final attack on the city of Berlin,
          knocking the German Reich out of World War 2. This led to the quick end World War 2, which ended just a few months after.

          On the 26th of April 1986, the Number 4 reactor in the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, Pripyat, Ukraine overheated and
          had a meltdown. This resulted in a large explosion in the plant, launching 1000s of tons of radioactive matter into the surrounding
          areas and air. This had a huge environmental and humanitarian impact, with hundreds of kilometers of environment becoming uninhabitable
          aswell as an estimated death toll of 30,000-60,000 by radiation scientists Fairlie and Sumner. Belarus was impacted the most due to the plant
          being located on the Belarus border, it is estimated that some areas won't be habitable for another 20,000 years due to the high concentrations
          of radioactive material.
        <br></p>
          March 1965, soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov made the first ever spacewalk. For ten minutes, Alexei floated outside of the
          Voskhod 2 capsule in the darkness of space. Never before had anything like this been done. When Alexei attempted to get back inside
          he realised that his spacesuit had overinflated so he had very little mobility. He ended up having to depressureize his spacesuit while
          floating out in space to be able to manouver back inside. This Voskhod 2 mission was rushed due to the soviets wanting to beat the USA in the race
          to explore space. This resulted in a huge advancement in space technology over a ten year period which allowed humans to travel to the moon, and soon mars.
