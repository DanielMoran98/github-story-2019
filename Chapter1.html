        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Spring is a great season. You know when spring comes around that the cold days of winter are over. It's like the cold dark days of winter saps the energy and life out of everybody.
          You can really notice the change in peoples mood once spring comes along and winter is left behind. I think the weather is one of the main reasons for this. The biggest complaint about
          Ireland from Irish people is the weather, so naturally once the warmer, dryer weather comes along it tends to cheer people up.
        <br></p>
        <p>
          One of the most noticable changes that marks the start of spring besides the weather is the plants and vegetation coming to life. The bare trees from winter start to grow back their leaves, tulips
          and daffodils start to pop up from the ground and the grass starts to grow quicker, leaving the smell of freshly cut grass in the air when it is finally cut.
        <br></p>
        <p>
          The wildlife also starts to increase, although it may not be as obvious when living in the city. But many creatures start to come out of hibernation at the start of spring, such
           as hedgehogs and even bats! Most noticable is the increase of birds chirping when you're out and about which you wouldn't normally hear as much during winter.
