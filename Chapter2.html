        <h3>Events</h3>
        <p>
          There are quite a few holidays throughout spring, St. Patricks day takes place on the 17th of March and was originally
          an Irish tradition but due to the mass emmigration of the Irish population over the years it has become a tradition in many countries around the world.
           The day is typically marked with everything being decorated in green and most cities will have a parade that people can watch.
          Easter is another big holiday in Ireland which takes place on April 21st. <br> Easter Sunday is a Christian holiday made to celebrate
          the ressurection of Jesus. Eating chocolate easter eggs and kids going easter egg hunts are common. There will also be a
          state ceremony outside of the GPO in Dublin to commemorate the 1916 rising which triggered events which led to the Republic
           of Ireland forming.
        <br></p>
        <p>
          There are endless interesting events this spring no matter what you're into. If you're into music, there are some big names
           performing such as Drake, Rod Stewart, UB40, Nicki Minaj and Wu-Tang Clan which will all be performing in the 3arena. If you
           want to see something different there is the RedBull cliff diving competition which will located at Grand Canal Dock.
